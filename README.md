# LFSR -Linear Feedback Shift Register
## MATLAB CODE for LFRS
### THis MATLAB Code work for any length of LFSR with given taps (feedback polynomial) -Universal
### There are two files LFSRnik1.m an LFSRnik2.m
### LFSRnik1
This function will return all the states of LFSR and will check Three fundamental Property of LFSR 
(1) Balance Property (2) Runlength Property (3) Autocorrelation Property

### LFSRnik2
This function will return only generated sequence will all the states of LFSR, no verification of properties are done
here. Use this function to avoid verification each time you execute the program
